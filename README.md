HMS - Hazard Management System
------------------------------

Pretty boring name it is, we know. This app does help you report issues that you do want to get fixed by your government. Fill in the issue details
upload a few images and mark the exact location in the map, share the issue with others on social media. When it becomes worse enough to be taken
care (well, we don't know what to do otherwise) the app lets you make campaigns and you can along with your friends ask the officials to fix the issue
for you. If it sounds interesting, or if you have more appealing ideas, please join us! :)

The latest code will be live here : [http://hms-staging.pagodabox.com/]
The project mockup will be kept updated here : [https://moqups.com/napster/M60UBHOu]
